      <p>Current best practices call for creating a 10-bit uncompressed file from an original analog signal.</p>
      <p>MIPoPS has chosen to use a Blackmagic Encoding system to create a 10-bit uncompressed file in an .mov (Quicktime) wrapper. Because that file can be as much as 100GB per hour of running time, we have chosen to transcode the preservation master to a lossless compressed FFV1 file with a .mkv (Matroska) wrapper that averages about 50GB per hour of running time.</p>
      <p>From the preservation master, which is now the FFV1 file, we can make DVDs, small files to post on the web, or mezzanine files, smaller losslessly compressed files that take up far less room on a network, external hard drive, or raid array.</p>

          <p><i>This document, created by the NYU Video at Risk project, is intended to take an institution step-by-step through the process of drafting a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the transfer of analog video formats to digital carriers for preservation. Whether or not you send a collection to a vendor, this document provides a good roadmap for the entire process.</i></p>
