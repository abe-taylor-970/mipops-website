-fix blog update so that it works for pictures

**********notes on pixels***********************
use @media(min-width:NNNpx)[] and max-width to adjust width
Phones : less than 768 px (xs)
Tablets : 768 px and up (s)
Desktops : 992 px and up (md)
Large desktops : 1200 px and up (l)


TO DO:
*) fix width of everything on main page so it all lines up. Maybe try setting padding:0px? Maybe bootstrap is doing it?
*) Add re-directs for all .php and send instead to directory with index.php. Also, add custom .css file in each directory, and fix bw-style.css to be broad styles
*) Add javascript and css file to make site work on IE10 Windows 8.
*) Add this line :   <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"> at top of file near head
*) for above two, see jumbotron example on getbootstrap.com 
*) Make members area look nice
*) fix ... at end of blog text so it isn't in middle of text vertically would need to detect < and make sure a matching > and if not a matching > then trim off the end back to < and probably also detect </ to make sure all tags match.
*) fix anchor tag in imported text so that it isn't displayed so big
*) https: change to http: for internet archives link
*) Get similar organizations to look right. There is some unused code in mipops.js about that.
*) one less pic of libby in main slideshow 
*) get menu to stay on top when scrolling down in mobile
**) Add login
**) Figure out donations page
**) fix wide picture on planning.php page
*)Get it to look nice on tablets
*)Change menu so that it displays before clicking? 
*)fix members.php to be evenly spaced on mobile
*)fix contact.php so that map is responsive to mobile
*)now that added responsive_iframe, does it work for video in video_blog.php?
