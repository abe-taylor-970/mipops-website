use @media(min-width:NNNpx)[] and max-width to adjust width
Phones : less than 768 px (xs)
Tablets : 768 px and up (s)
Desktops : 992 px and up (md)
Large desktops : 1200 px and up (l)

TO DO:
**) Get carousel to not move everything when it goes from slide to slide
**) Get facebook icon added to menu
*) Get similar organizations to look right. There is some unused code in mipops.js about that.
*) one less pic of libby in main slideshow 
*) get menu to stay on top when scrolling down in mobile
**) Add login
**) Figure out donations page
**) fix wide picture on planning.php page
*)Get it to look nice on tablets
*)Change menu so that it displays before clicking? 
*)fix members.php to be evenly spaced on mobile
*)fix contact.php so that map is responsive to mobile
*)now that added responsive_iframe, does it work for video in video_blog.php?
