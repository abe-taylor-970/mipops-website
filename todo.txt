TO DO
-----
MAIN:
  **) change whole site so that it isn't using .php everywhere. Probably by using server-side includes. 
  ?) top_bar picture too tall on tablet
  *) magnetic.php and possibly others, make sure there is a little space between the page and the picture. 
  *) Check analytics for web page and see what browsers people are using. Also, look at all the stats.
  *) Make members area look nice
  *) will be changing members and membership area to be new name.
  *) Change menu so that it displays before clicking? 
  *) look at slideshow and see if needs to be adjusted. maybe only one picture of the inside of that device. Note hard to do unless I get more pictures from Rachel. 
  *) For below two, see jumbotron example on getbootstrap.com
    1) Add javascript and css file to make site work on IE10 Windows 8.
    2) Add this line :   <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"> at top of file near head

NOTES
-----
*) search has two pages that need to be adjusted if any changes occur to them. One is top_bar.php (if any changes occur, need to change top_bar_copy.html). The other is javascript.php (if any changes occur, need to change footer.htm under search)
*) Need to re-index site if any pages are added or changed. When doing this, need to delete the link to index.php (since it is a duplicate)
