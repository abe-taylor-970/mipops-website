          <p>The New Museum dedicated its Fifth Floor gallery space to "XFR STN" (Transfer Station), an open-door artist-centered media archiving project. "XFR STN" initially arose from the need to preserve the Monday/Wednesday/Friday Video Club distribution project. The "XFR STN" at the New Museum will also address the wider need in the community of artists for access to media capture and migration services as a means to preserve creative productions stored in aging and obsolete audiovisual and digital formats.</p>
