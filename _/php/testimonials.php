          <p>"I work with the Kubota Garden Foundation to help preserve what's known about the Garden's history and development. Much of this lore has been passed down in oral tradition. MIPoPS has been a great in helping us transferring historically important video interviews to digital format. This enables us to use them to interpret the site, and provides backup for the information they contain."</p>

          <p>"MIPoPS has created a unique workshop of equipment and has developed the skills to work with the interface of old and new technology... It was impressive to see the skill and the desire to capture the best possible image during the archival process and I feel I learned a tremendous amount about this and the value of preserving these creative treasures."</p>

          <p>"In my 35 years as an archivist – and one who is very active in professional circles – this is the most exciting development I've been associated with. This kind of "consortium" work can be a huge benefit to the profession and serve as a great model."</p>

      <p>"As one of the organizations selected to work with MIPoPS as part of their last 4Culture grant, we began to make some headway with our backlog by viewing boxes of tapes that had not seen the light of day since the 1970s and 1980s. Through our work with MIPoPS, we have been able to provide online access to a number of unique video segments – for example: local Native American historian David Buerge describing the early relationship with local tribes and the Catholic Church, the Columbia River pastoral project, a major environmental protection effort by 12 local bishops, and the history and renovation of Seattle's St. James Cathedral, one of the most historically significant structures in Western Washington."</p>
