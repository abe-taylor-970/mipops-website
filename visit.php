      <h1>What to Expect on Your First Visit to MIPOPS</h1>

      <div class="row type2">
        <ul>
          <li>MIPOPS is located on Floor 3 of City Hall, 600 Fourth Avenue, Seattle.  Entrances are on Fourth and Fifth Avenues and on Cherry.  Public transportation is the best option as parking in the vicinity is expensive.</li>
          <li>Check in with the reception desk for the Office of the City Clerk and we will escort you to the MIPOPS space.</li>  
          <li><b>Bring a Hard drive formatted for your office environment - windows or mac.</b></li> 
          <li>Videos are digitized in <i>real time</i>; you might not want to bring more than you have time for.</li>
          <li>Three primary steps included: <ol><li>digitizing video tape</li><li>transcoding resulting .mov file to file format(s) of your choice</li><li>copying files onto your media.</li></ol></li>
          <li>There is no storage space for either analog objects or digital files. Be prepared to take your items with you at the end of the day.</li>
          <li>Do as much appraisal as possible in advance.</li>
          <li>If possible, tell us in advance which formats you'll be bringing in. We can digitize VHS, U-Matic, Betcam SP, Digital Betacam, Hi 8, Mini DV and DV Cam</li>
          <li>If labels are not adhered well, please remove them. Have info about what's on the label written somewhere else, if you think you'll need it.</li>
          <li>Refer to the document: "Preparing Video for Capture"</li> 
          <li>Let us know what file formats you would like your video transferred to.  The scripts for digitizing into specific formats are written in ffmpeg; if you need formats other than mpeg4 and ffv1 please let us know ahead of time. Please email or call and we can discuss this to you.</li>
          <li>Expect to work one-on-one with someone on your first visit; it won't be long before you'll be on your own, but even then there will be someone there to help if you need it</li>
        </ul>
