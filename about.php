      <p>Moving Image Preservation of Puget Sound (MIPoPS) supports video tape digitization and preservation by archives, museums, libraries, historical societies, science and art organizations, and related institutions that have analog video in their collections but have neither the resources nor expertise to address it. Because most institutions no longer possess video tape decks, they might not be able to identify the content of their tapes. MIPOPS provides guidance in identifying tape format, content and  condition and will advise on known, format-specific preservation issues. Based on this initial evaluation, MIPOPS can help determine whether use of the MIPOPS transfer station is appropriate for a collection.</p>
      <br />
      <p>MIPoPS can work with a variety of videotape formats including <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>" Umatic, VHS, Betacam (SP and Digital), MiniDV, 1", and DVCam. Using the MIPOPS video transfer station, users can create a preservation-quality digital file (ffv1 format, recognized by moving image archivists) and an access copy (mp4).  MIPoPS will advise on maintaining the original material as well as the newly created digital files. Participants will be asked to have at least one migrated video posted to the MIPoPS Internet Archive site.</p>
